# Project Proposal : Dancing Cloud Audio Visualizer
For my final project, I would like to create a dancing cloud audio visualizer where I can input a song and have an animation that "dances" to the beat of the music. Meanwhile, there will be an audio visualizer in the background that captures the beat or frequencies of the music being played. The dancing cloud will just be a collection of points moving randomly in a given area and these points will be connected with a line once they come within a certain distance of one another. Additionally, these points will undergo certain affects when a high frequency is captured.

Some libraries that may be used for this project could include the following:
1. ofSoundPlayer

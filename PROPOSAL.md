# Project Proposal : Dancing Cloud Audio Visualizer
For my final project, I would like to create a dancing cloud audio visualizer where I can input a song and have an animation that "dances" to the beat of the music. Meanwhile, there will be an audio visualizer in the background that captures the beat of music. I would like to support the following actions:

1. Pause, play, and switch between songs
2. Upload multiple songs or playlists (preferably from Spotify)
3. Display the lyrics of a given song
4. Rotate the dancing cloud (by clicking and dragging)

I would also like to have the background color change depending on the beat of the song being played.

Some libraries that may be used for this project could include the following:
1. ofSoundPlayer
